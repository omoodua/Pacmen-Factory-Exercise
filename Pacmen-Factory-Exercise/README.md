# Pacmen-Factory-Exercise
This is my MIT Project

This is called the Pacmen Factory. This showcases Pacmen images that pop out of existence at the click of a button. The Pacmen move randomly to the edge of the screen, back and forth.
# How To Run
Clone the repository on your local machine and drag index.html on your browser, then its ready to run
